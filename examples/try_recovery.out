=== Railway-Oriented Programming with Try ===

1. Processing user id=1:
   Success: Alice (verified) <alice@example.com>

2. Processing user id=-1 (invalid):
   Failure: id: must be positive

3. Processing user id=999 (not found):
   Failure: user not found

=== Recovery Patterns ===

4. Recover with default user:
   Result: Guest <guest@example.com>

5. RecoverWith - try fetching backup user:
   Recovered: Alice

=== Chaining with Map ===

6. Extract user name with Map:
   Name: Alice

7. Chain Maps to get email length:
   Email length: 17

=== ForEach Side Effects ===

8. ForEach on Success:
   Processing user: Alice

9. ForEach on Failure (no output expected):
   (ForEach skipped for Failure)

=== Conversion Examples ===

10. Try to Option:
   Success -> Option.IsDefined(): true
   Failure -> Option.IsEmpty(): true

11. Try to Either:
   Success -> Either.IsRight(): true
   Failure -> Either.IsLeft(): true
