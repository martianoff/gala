# TODO

- [x] Proper handling pattern matching / unapply
- [x] Basic immutable data structures
- [x] Type parameters in methods (e.g. Option,Map) in GALA
- [x] Generalize Option monad transpiler pattern that is used for Map, FlatMap, ForEach and others that transforms a: A with a.Map(b B): B to std.Map(a A, b B)[A, B]. The idea is to let GALA users to create similar functions inside GALA code base. Implement Either[A, B] monad in GALA as an example
- [x] Example tests via `bazel test`
- [x] Support filters in pattern matching
- [x] Avoid gala style pattern matching
- [x] Support Some/None as structs in GALA
- [x] Pattern matching for types
- [x] Remove special casing for Tuples
- [x] Extend Tuples class to Tuple3, Tuple4 ... Tuple10. Make (A, B) a synonym of Tuple(A,B), (A, B, C) a synonym of Tuple(A,B,C) and so on. Synonyms should work for construction and pattern matching
- [x] Imported packages in GALA are analyzed with analyzers so they can support GALA features like generic methods
- [x] Dependency management
- [x] Test framework
- [x] JetBrains language plugin
- [x] Pointers to immutable vars
- [x] TreeSet
- [ ] Hash() function should be dynamically generated?
- [x] Futures
- [x] Remove native make/slices from GALA but make them available through STD package
- [x] Refactor documentation removing all explicit type where they are not required i.e. `var s = HashSetOf[int](1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` should be `var s = HashSetOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
- [x] Mutable and immutable Maps
- [x] Add Collect API to all collections
- [x] Partial functions
- [x] Restrict the GO map type declaration directly in GALA. Create required GO map functions inside std. Rewrite collections packages using std Maps. Leave ToGoMap functions for compatibility with GO apps
- [x] Go pkg for go native primitives (maps, slices, channels etc)
- [ ] Drop reflection usage for immutable vars for better performance
- [ ] Official bazel module
